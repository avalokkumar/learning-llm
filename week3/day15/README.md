# Week 3 Day 15: Pretraining a Small GPT-Style Model

## Overview

Today serves as the capstone for Week 3, where we bring together everything we've learned to pretrain a small, `nanoGPT`-style language model from scratch. We will build an end-to-end pipeline that includes data preparation, model definition, a robust training loop, and text generation. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding of the entire pretraining process.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate data processing, tokenization, and batching into a single pipeline.
- Build and configure a small, decoder-only transformer model.
- Implement an end-to-end pretraining loop with all the necessary components (optimizer, scheduler, AMP, etc.).
- Train the model on a small, custom corpus.
- Generate text from the pretrained model to evaluate its capabilities.

## Pretraining a `nanoGPT`-Style Model

### ðŸŒŸ Layman's Understanding

Imagine teaching a baby its first language by reading it a small collection of children's books over and over. The baby doesn't have any prior knowledge of language; it learns patterns, words, and sentence structures entirely from those books. Pretraining a small model is similar. We're creating a "digital brain" (our model) from scratch and teaching it the fundamentals of a language by feeding it a specific text corpus. Our goal isn't to make it an expert on everything, but to teach it the language style of our "books" so it can generate new text that sounds similar.

### ðŸ“š Basic Understanding

Pretraining a `nanoGPT`-style model involves training a decoder-only transformer on a large text corpus using a causal language modeling objective (i.e., next-token prediction). The key steps are:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a text corpus (e.g., a collection of classic books, Wikipedia articles, or code).
2. **Tokenization**: Create a vocabulary and a tokenizer to convert the text into a sequence of numerical IDs.
3. **Data Preparation**: Split the data into training and validation sets and prepare it for efficient loading.
4. **Model Definition**: Define a GPT-style, decoder-only transformer architecture.
5. **Training**: Run a robust training loop that includes an optimizer (AdamW), a learning rate scheduler, mixed precision, and monitoring.
6. **Generation**: Use the trained model to generate new text, starting from a prompt.

This process creates a "base model" that has learned the statistical patterns of the training data.

### ðŸ”¬ Intermediate Understanding

From a technical standpoint, pretraining a `nanoGPT`-style model requires careful integration of several components:

1. **Data Pipeline**: An efficient `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` that handles tokenization, sequence packing, and batching. For large datasets, memory-mapped files are often used to avoid loading the entire corpus into RAM.
2. **Model Architecture**: A decoder-only transformer stack. Key hyperparameters include `vocab_size`, `d_model` (embedding dimension), `n_head` (number of attention heads), `n_layer` (number of transformer blocks), and `dropout`.
3. **Initialization**: Proper weight initialization (e.g., Xavier or Kaiming) is crucial. GPT-2/3 papers suggest initializing residual projection weights with a smaller variance.
4. **Training Loop**: The loop must correctly handle:
    - **Causal Masking**: To ensure the model only sees past tokens.
    - **Loss Calculation**: Cross-entropy loss between the model's predicted logits and the shifted target tokens.
    - **Optimization**: AdamW with decoupled weight decay.
    - **Scheduling**: A cosine decay schedule with a linear warmup period is standard.
    - **Mixed Precision (AMP)**: To speed up training and reduce memory usage.
    - **Gradient Clipping**: To prevent exploding gradients and stabilize training.

5. **Text Generation (Inference)**:
    - An autoregressive loop where the model predicts one token at a time.
    - The predicted token is fed back as input for the next step.
    - Sampling strategies like temperature scaling, top-k, or nucleus (top-p) sampling are used to control the randomness and creativity of the generated text.

### ðŸŽ“ Advanced Understanding

At a more advanced level, pretraining involves sophisticated considerations that mirror those used in state-of-the-art research:

1. **Scaling Laws**: The performance of a language model is a predictable function of model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training. Chinchilla's scaling laws suggest that for optimal performance, model size and dataset size should be scaled in roughly equal proportion.
2. **Compute-Optimal Training**: Finding the right balance of hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate) for a given hardware setup to maximize throughput (tokens/second) without compromising convergence. This often involves detailed profiling.
3. **Data Quality and Mixture**: The composition of the pretraining corpus has a profound impact on the model's capabilities. The ideal mixture of web text, books, code, and other domains is an active area of research. Data decontamination (removing downstream evaluation tasks from the training set) is also critical for unbiased evaluation.
4. **Architectural Nuances**: Modern GPT-style models incorporate subtle but important changes:
    - **Pre-LayerNorm**: Applying Layer Normalization before the attention and feed-forward blocks for better stability.
    - **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**: An alternative to learned or sinusoidal positional encodings that has shown better performance, especially for long sequences.
    - **SwiGLU Activation**: A variant of the GLU activation function used in the feed-forward network, which has been shown to improve performance.
5. **Training Stability at Scale**: At very large scales, training can become unstable. Techniques to mitigate this include careful initialization, learning rate scheduling, and sometimes even changes to the numerics of the attention mechanism (e.g., using higher precision for softmax).

## End-to-End Pretraining Pipeline

### ðŸŒŸ Layman's Understanding

Building our pipeline is like setting up an automated factory. Raw materials (text) come in one end, go through a series of processing steps (tokenizing, batching), are assembled into a product (training the model), and the finished goods (a trained model that can write text) come out the other end. Our job is to design each machine in the factory and make sure they all work together smoothly.

### ðŸ“š Basic Understanding

Our end-to-end pipeline will consist of the following sequential steps:

1. **Load Data**: Read a text file (e.g., `input.txt`) into memory.
2. **Tokenize**: Build a character-level or subword-level tokenizer and encode the entire text.
3. **Create Datasets**: Split the tokenized data into training and validation sets.
4. **Instantiate Model**: Create an instance of our GPT-style model.
5. **Configure Trainer**: Set up the optimizer, scheduler, and other training components.
6. **Run Training**: Execute the training loop for a specified number of epochs or steps.
7. **Generate Text**: Use the final trained model to generate new text samples.

### ðŸ”¬ Intermediate Understanding

A more detailed, code-oriented view of the pipeline would look like this:

```python
# 1. Data Loading and Preparation
with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
tokenizer = CharacterTokenizer(text)
data = torch.tensor(tokenizer.encode(text), dtype=torch.long)
n = int(0.9 * len(data))
train_data = data[:n]
val_data = data[n:]

# 2. Model Definition
model = GPT(vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size, ...)

# 3. Training Configuration
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# 4. Training Loop
def get_batch(split):
    # ... function to get a batch of data

for step in range(max_steps):
    xb, yb = get_batch('train')
    logits, loss = model(xb, yb)
    optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# 5. Generation
context = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(model.generate(context, max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist())
```

This structure, popularized by Andrej Karpathy's `nanoGPT`, provides a clear and concise implementation of the entire pretraining process.

### ðŸŽ“ Advanced Understanding

For a production-grade or research-level pipeline, several additional layers of abstraction and functionality are necessary:

1. **Configuration Management**: Using Hydra or a similar library to manage all hyperparameters, model configurations, and dataset paths in a structured and reproducible way.
2. **Trainer Class**: Abstracting the training loop into a `Trainer` class that handles device placement, distributed training (DDP), mixed precision, checkpointing, and logging.
3. **Data Abstraction**: A flexible `DataManager` that can handle different datasets, tokenizers, and preprocessing steps, often involving on-the-fly tokenization and streaming from disk for massive datasets.
4. **Callbacks and Hooks**: A system of callbacks that allows for modular functionality, such as custom logging, evaluation on downstream tasks during pretraining, or dynamic hyperparameter adjustments.
5. **Distributed Training**: Integrating with `torch.distributed` for multi-GPU and multi-node training, including setting up process groups and wrapping the model with `DistributedDataParallel`.

## Practical Exercise: Pretrain Your Own `nanoGPT`

3. Implement a character-level tokenizer.
4. Define a minimal, decoder-only GPT model.
5. Write a training loop that incorporates AdamW and tracks loss.
6. Implement a `generate` function to produce new text from the trained model.
7. Observe how the quality of the generated text improves as the model trains.
