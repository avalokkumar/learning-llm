## Introduction to LLM Evaluation

### Layman's Explanation

Imagine you've trained a student to answer questions on many subjects. How do you know if they've actually learned the material? You'd give them tests on different topics, with varying difficulty levels, and see how they perform. LLM evaluation is similarâ€”we create standardized tests for AI models to measure their abilities across different skills, from factual knowledge to reasoning to safety. These tests help us understand what models are good at, where they struggle, and how they compare to each other or to human performance.

### Basic Concept

Language Model Evaluation refers to the systematic assessment of a model's capabilities, limitations, and behaviors across various dimensions. Proper evaluation is crucial for understanding model performance, identifying areas for improvement, ensuring safety and reliability, and making informed decisions about deployment.

### MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)

**Description**: MMLU evaluates models across 57 subjects spanning STEM, humanities, social sciences, and more, testing both world knowledge and problem-solving ability.

**Format**: Multiple-choice questions across diverse subjects:

- Elementary mathematics
- US history
- Computer science
- Law
- Ethics
- And many more

**Scoring**: Accuracy per subject and overall average

**Example**:

```
Question: Which of the following is a correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum?
A) The total momentum of an isolated system remains constant regardless of interactions between objects in the system.
B) The momentum of an object remains constant unless acted upon by an external force.
C) The total energy of an isolated system remains constant regardless of interactions between objects in the system.
D) The kinetic energy of an object remains constant unless acted upon by an external force.
Answer: A
```

### HellaSwag

**Description**: Tests common sense reasoning through sentence completion tasks that require understanding of physical, social, and causal reasoning.

**Format**: Given a context, select the most plausible continuation from four options

**Scoring**: Accuracy (percentage of correct completions)

**Example**:

```
Context: A woman is outside with a bucket and a dog. The woman tosses a tennis ball. The dog
A) runs to get the ball and brings it back to the woman.
B) jumps into the bucket and waits for a treat.
C) takes the bucket and fills it with water.
D) starts to bark loudly and runs away from the woman.
Answer: A
```

### TruthfulQA

**Description**: Evaluates a model's tendency to reproduce falsehoods commonly believed by humans, testing both truthfulness and informativeness.

**Format**: Questions designed to elicit common misconceptions, with both true and false answers provided

**Scoring**:

- Truth score: How factually accurate the response is
- Informativeness score: How helpful and relevant the response is

**Example**:

```
Question: What happens if you wish upon a star?
False Answer: If you wish upon a star, your dreams will come true.
True Answer: Wishing upon a star has no causal effect on achieving your dreams or goals.
```

### GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)

**Description**: Tests mathematical reasoning through grade school math word problems that require multi-step solutions.

**Format**: Word problems requiring arithmetic operations, basic algebra, and logical reasoning

**Scoring**: Accuracy (percentage of correct final answers)

**Example**:

```
Question: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Answer: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for muffins. So she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market. At $2 per egg, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.
```

### HumanEval

**Description**: Evaluates code generation capabilities through programming problems that test understanding of algorithms, data structures, and language-specific features.

**Format**: Function signature and docstring, with the model required to complete the implementation

**Scoring**: Pass@k metric (probability that at least one correct solution appears in k samples)

**Example**:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """
    Given a list of integers, sort the list and return the sum of the three largest elements.
    If the list has fewer than three elements, return the sum of all elements.
    """
    # [Model generates code here]
```

- 4: Mostly accurate with minor errors that don't affect understanding
- 3: Some important facts are incorrect or misrepresented
- 2: Major factual errors that change the meaning
- 1: Summary is completely inaccurate

**Conciseness (1-5)**:

- 5: Optimal length, no unnecessary information
- 4: Slightly verbose but still focused
- 3: Contains some unnecessary details
- 2: Significantly longer than needed with many irrelevant details
- 1: Extremely verbose or too short to be useful

**Completeness (1-5)**:

- 5: Captures all key points and important details
- 4: Captures most key points with minor omissions
- 3: Captures some key points but misses others
- 2: Misses most key points
- 1: Fails to capture any key points

**Relevance (1-5)**:

- 5: Focuses entirely on the most important information
- 4: Mostly focuses on important information with minor digressions
- 3: Includes some irrelevant information
- 2: Focuses primarily on unimportant details
- 1: Completely misses the point of the email

## Measuring and Reducing Hallucinations

### What are Hallucinations?

Hallucinations in language models refer to generated content that is factually incorrect, internally inconsistent, or not supported by the provided context or real-world knowledge.

    A --> C[Contextual Hallucinations]
    A --> D[Logical Hallucinations]
    
    B --> B1[Incorrect facts]
    B --> B2[Made-up statistics]
    B --> B3[False attributions]
    
    C --> C1[Unsupported by context]
    C --> C2[Contradicts given information]
    C --> C3[Fabricated context details]
    
    D --> D1[Internal contradictions]
    D --> D2[Impossible scenarios]
    D --> D3[Logical fallacies]
```
