    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Policy Objectives\n",

    "- Contains explicit sexual content\n",
    "- Promotes self-harm or suicide\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Borderline Content Handling\n",
    "For content that falls into gray areas:\n",
    "- Apply the precautionary principle when uncertain\n",
    "- Consider context and intent\n",
    "- Provide educational alternatives when appropriate\n",
    "- Escalate to human review when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Cultural and Contextual Considerations\n",
    "- Recognize that norms vary across cultures and contexts\n",
    "- Adapt safety measures to local legal and cultural requirements\n",
    "- Provide context-specific guidance when appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Technical Safety Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Input Filtering Mechanisms\n",
    "- Keyword and pattern matching for prohibited content\n",
    "- Machine learning classifiers for toxicity detection\n",
    "- Semantic understanding for context-aware filtering\n",

    "### 4.2 Output Moderation Systems\n",
    "- Multi-level content filtering\n",
    "- Refusal policies for harmful requests\n",
    "- Output sanitization for borderline content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Monitoring and Logging Requirements\n",
    "- Log all refused requests for analysis\n",
    "- Monitor model outputs for safety compliance\n",
    "- Track safety metrics over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Operational Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 User Reporting Mechanisms\n",
    "- Provide clear channels for users to report safety concerns\n",
    "- Acknowledge reports within 24 hours\n",
    "- Investigate and respond to reports within 72 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Incident Response Protocol\n",
    "- Immediate containment of identified issues\n",
    "- Root cause analysis\n",
    "- Implementation of fixes and mitigations\n",
    "- Post-incident review and policy updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Escalation Procedures\n",
    "- Define escalation paths for different severity levels\n",
    "- Establish on-call rotation for critical issues\n",
    "- Set response time expectations based on severity\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Red-Team Testing Requirements\n",
    "- Conduct red-team testing before each major release\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this two-part notebook, we've explored practical implementations of safety measures for language models, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content Filtering**: Building basic and ML-based content filters to detect harmful content\n",
    "2. **Refusal Policies**: Implementing policies for when and how to refuse harmful requests\n",
    "3. **Red-Teaming**: Creating a framework for systematically testing model safety\n",
    "4. **Safety Evaluation**: Developing comprehensive evaluation methods for model safety\n",
    "5. **Safety Policy**: Drafting a template for a comprehensive safety policy\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques form the foundation of responsible language model deployment. By implementing these safety measures, we can help ensure that language models are used in ways that benefit society while minimizing potential harms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As language models continue to advance, safety techniques must evolve alongside them. This requires ongoing research, collaboration across the AI community, and a commitment to responsible development practices."
