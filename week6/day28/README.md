# Day 28: Knowledge Distillation for LLMs

Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for creating smaller, more efficient models that retain much of the performance of larger models. Today, we'll explore how to apply knowledge distillation to large language models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of knowledge distillation
- Learn about teacher-student model architectures
- Explore different distillation objectives (logits, soft targets, etc.)
- Implement knowledge distillation for language models
- Generate high-quality datasets for distillation

## 1. Introduction to Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model (the student) is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger model (the teacher).

    A[Large Teacher Model] -->|Transfers Knowledge| B[Small Student Model]
    C[Training Data] --> A
    C --> B
    A -->|Soft Targets| B
    
    style A fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Why Distill Language Models?

1. **Deployment Efficiency**: Smaller models require less memory and compute
2. **Inference Speed**: Faster response times for real-time applications
3. **Resource Accessibility**: Run models on edge devices or consumer hardware
4. **Cost Reduction**: Lower computational costs for serving predictions

## 2. The Knowledge Distillation Framework

### The Teacher-Student Architecture

```mermaid

    A[Input Text] --> B[Teacher Model]
    A --> C[Student Model]
    
    B -->|Logits/Embeddings| D{Distillation Loss}
    C -->|Predictions| D
    
    E[Ground Truth] --> F{Task Loss}
    C -->|Predictions| F
    
    D --> G{Combined Loss}
    F --> G
    
    G -->|Backpropagation| C
    
    style B fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#d5e5f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Key Components

1. **Teacher Model**: A large, high-performing pre-trained model
2. **Student Model**: A smaller model with fewer parameters
3. **Distillation Loss**: Measures how well the student mimics the teacher
4. **Task Loss**: Ensures the student performs well on the original task
5. **Temperature Parameter**: Controls the softness of probability distributions

## 3. Types of Knowledge Distillation

### Response-Based Distillation

The student learns from the final outputs (logits or probabilities) of the teacher.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Teacher]
    A --> C[Student]
    B -->|Soft Targets| D{KL Divergence}
    C -->|Predictions| D
    D -->|Loss| C
    
    style B fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Feature-Based Distillation

The student learns to mimic the internal representations (embeddings, hidden states) of the teacher.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Teacher]
    A --> C[Student]
    B -->|Hidden States| D{MSE Loss}
    C -->|Hidden States| D
    D -->|Loss| C
    
    style B fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Relation-Based Distillation

The student learns the relationships between different inputs or tokens as captured by the teacher.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Teacher]
    A --> C[Student]
    B -->|Attention Maps| D{Attention Transfer}
    C -->|Attention Maps| D
    D -->|Loss| C
    
    style B fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## 4. Distillation Objectives

### Temperature Scaling

Temperature scaling controls the "softness" of the probability distribution:

$$q_i = \frac{\exp(z_i/T)}{\sum_j \exp(z_j/T)}$$

Where:
- $q_i$ is the softened probability
- $z_i$ is the logit
- $T$ is the temperature (higher values produce softer distributions)

### Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss

The KL divergence measures how different the student's distribution is from the teacher's:

$$L_{KL} = T^2 \sum_i p_i \log\frac{p_i}{q_i}$$

Where:
- $p_i$ is the teacher's probability for class $i$
- $q_i$ is the student's probability for class $i$
- $T$ is the temperature

### Combined Loss

The final loss is typically a combination of distillation loss and task loss:

$$L = \alpha L_{task} + (1-\alpha) L_{distill}$$

Where:
- $L_{task}$ is the standard task loss (e.g., cross-entropy with hard labels)
- $L_{distill}$ is the distillation loss (e.g., KL divergence)
- $\alpha$ is a weighting parameter

## 5. Dataset Generation for Distillation

Creating a high-quality dataset is crucial for effective distillation.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Data Sources] --> B{Dataset Generation}
    B --> C[Unlabeled Data]
    B --> D[Labeled Data]
    B --> E[Synthetic Data]
    
    C --> F[Teacher Labeling]
    D --> G[Combined Labels]
    E --> F
    
    F --> H[Distillation Dataset]
    G --> H
    
    style H fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Approaches to Dataset Creation

1. **Teacher Labeling**: Use the teacher model to generate soft labels for unlabeled data
2. **Data Augmentation**: Create variations of existing examples
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use the teacher to generate entirely new examples
4. **Active Learning**: Select the most informative examples for distillation
5. **Domain-Specific Data**: Focus on data relevant to the target application

## 6. Distillation Strategies for LLMs

### Progressive Distillation

Train the student in stages, gradually increasing complexity:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Teacher] -->|Distill| B[Intermediate Model 1]
    B -->|Distill| C[Intermediate Model 2]
    C -->|Distill| D[Final Student]
    
    style A fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Layer-wise Distillation

Distill knowledge from specific layers of the teacher to corresponding layers of the student:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Teacher Layer 1] -->|Distill| E[Student Layer 1]
    B[Teacher Layer 2] -->|Distill| F[Student Layer 2]
    C[Teacher Layer N] -->|Distill| G[Student Layer M]
    
    style A fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Task-Specific Distillation

Focus distillation on specific tasks or capabilities:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Teacher] -->|QA Distillation| B[QA Student]
    A -->|Summarization Distillation| C[Summarization Student]
    A -->|Translation Distillation| D[Translation Student]
    
    style A fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#d5f9e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## 7. Architectural Considerations for Student Models

### Student Architecture Options

1. **Same Architecture, Fewer Layers**: Reduce depth (e.g., 24 layers → 6 layers)
2. **Same Architecture, Smaller Hidden Size**: Reduce width (e.g., 1024 dims → 512 dims)
3. **Different Architecture**: Use a more efficient architecture (e.g., MobileBERT, DistilBERT)
4. **Quantized Models**: Combine distillation with quantization
5. **Pruned Models**: Remove less important weights or attention heads

### Initialization Strategies

1. **Random Initialization**: Start with a randomly initialized student
2. **Layer Selection**: Initialize with selected layers from the teacher
3. **Parameter Averaging**: Initialize with averaged parameters from teacher layers
4. **Pre-trained Initialization**: Start with a smaller pre-trained model

## 8. Evaluating Distilled Models

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Goal |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Task Performance** | Accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc. on downstream tasks | Minimize gap with teacher |
| **Inference Speed** | Time to generate predictions | Significant improvement over teacher |
| **Memory Usage** | RAM required for model weights and activations | Significant reduction from teacher |
| **Model Size** | Number of parameters or disk space | Significant reduction from teacher |

### Evaluation Strategies

1. **Task Benchmarks**: Evaluate on standard NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc.)
2. **Generalization Tests**: Test on out-of-distribution data
3. **Ablation Studies**: Analyze the impact of different distillation components
4. **Efficiency Profiling**: Measure throughput, latency, and memory usage

## 9. Successful Distilled LLMs

Several successful distilled language models have been developed:

| Model | Teacher | Size Reduction | Performance Retention |
|-------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **DistilBERT** | BERT | 40% fewer parameters | 97% of BERT performance |
| **TinyBERT** | BERT | 7.5x smaller | 96% of BERT performance |
| **MobileBERT** | BERT | 4.3x smaller | Matches BERT performance |
| **DistilGPT2** | GPT-2 | 2x smaller | Strong generation capabilities |
| **Distil-RoBERTa** | RoBERTa | 2x smaller | 95% of RoBERTa performance |

## Conclusion

Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for creating smaller, more efficient language models without sacrificing too much performance. By carefully designing the teacher-student architecture, distillation objectives, and training data, we can create models that are practical for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

In the next part, we'll implement knowledge distillation for a language model and evaluate its performance.
